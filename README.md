Poutine
==============================================================================

A collection of widgets that provide a pygame Sprite interface

Goal:
-----

- simple to use
- few dependencies as possible (pygame should be the only dep)
- not tied to a framework
- easy to subclass, so the developer can insert it into THEIR framework


Acronym:
--------
POUTINE stands for:
Pygame
Objects for
User 
(The t stands for nothing)
Interface widgets for
Next-generation
Excellence

(I'm on a rampage!)
